There are various file formats commonly encountered in the C64 emulation 
scene.

The most common of these are T64 and D64, which are both "containers."
T64 is a "virtual tape" format, where D64 is a byte-for-byte representation
of an original 1541 formatted disk.

Both T64 and D64 are containers in the sense that they are single "host" 
files which contain multiple C64 files. (In the case of D64 images, the 
contents may not even be CBM-DOS files at all.)

There are also single-file formats, with .PRG and .CRT being the most common.

A .PRG file is a host file that contains the bytes from a single CBM file.
For a program, the first two bytes will be the load address, followed by
actual program bytes.

A .CRT file contains the bytes of a C64 cartridge.
