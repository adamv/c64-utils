A ".D64" file is a 1541 disk image containing the data bytes (and rarely, a
set of per-track errors.) There is no header or meta-information captured,
so there is no fool-proof way to tell if a random file is a disk image (though
typically it will conform to CBM-DOS formatting.)


There are four disk types, differentiated by the byte size of the file.

Disk type                  Size
---------                  ------
35 track, no errors        174848
35 track, 683 error bytes  175531
40 track, no errors        196608
40 track, 768 error bytes  197376


Tracks on a disk contain different numbers of sectors; there are fewer
sectors on tracks closer to the center of the disk.

    Sectors per track for each of 4 groups
    sectors_per_group = (21, 19, 18, 17)

    Last numbered sector in each size group:
    last_sized_track = (17, 24, 30, 40)



Dos directory entry format.

  Bytes: $00-1F: First directory entry
          00-01: Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00 $00 if
                 not the first entry in the sector)
             02: File type.
                 Typical values for this location are:
                   $00 - Scratched (deleted file entry)
                    80 - DEL
                    81 - SEQ
                    82 - PRG
                    83 - USR
                    84 - REL
                 Bit 0-3: The actual filetype
                          000 (0) - DEL
                          001 (1) - SEQ
                          010 (2) - PRG
                          011 (3) - USR
                          100 (4) - REL
                          Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce
                          very strange results. The 1541 is inconsistent in
                          how it treats these bits. Some routines use all 4
                          bits, others ignore bit 3,  resulting  in  values
                          from 0-7.
                 Bit   4: Not used
                 Bit   5: Used only during SAVE-@ replacement
                 Bit   6: Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
                 Bit   7: Closed flag  (Not  set  produces  "*", or "splat"
                          files)
          03-04: Track/sector location of first sector of file
          05-14: 16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
          15-16: Track/Sector location of first side-sector block (REL file
                 only)
             17: REL file record length (REL file only, max. value 254)
          18-1D: Unused (except with GEOS disks)
          1E-1F: File size in sectors, low/high byte  order  ($1E+$1F*256).
                 The approx. filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254
