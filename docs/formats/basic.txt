This document explains how to "detokenize" a C64 BASIC program.

While C64 BASIC is specifically addressed, other CBM BASICs differ in small
details, such as the default BASIC RAM address and the specific commands 
(tokens) supported.


Notes:
    The 6510 is a little-endian CPU, which means that words 
    (16-bit / 2-byte values) will typically appear low byte first.

File Format
===========

Overview
--------

A BASIC file is like any other PRG file, a load address followed by the exact
bytes that were in memory at that address.

[lo,hi] Load Address of this file, normally 2049.
(...) BASIC program lines, each terminated with a 0.
[0,0] Two zeros, signalling the end of the program
(...) Possible extra non-BASIC bytes contained in this program.


Load Address
------------
The first word of the file are the "load address" (lo/hi).

For normal C64 BASIC programs, this will be $01,$80 = 2049, which is the 
default start of BASIC program RAM. The SAVE command will always save this 
address. A normal LOAD command will always load to this address, regardless
of the actual value stored here.

A non-standard load address can mean one of several things:
* That the BASIC program was saved on a different CBM machine, which uses
  a different load address.

* The file is not a BASIC program, but a machine language program or
  other data.
  
* The file is a specially-crafted assembly/BASIC hybrid, typically done to
  implement auto-loading files.
